      <img src="img/me.png" />
      <p>Web development is my passion. I like imagining how things will move once someone, somewhere in the world who I've never met starts using the site I've created.</p>
      
      <p>I am pursuing my passion as a student majoring in Graphic Design at American University. I am also minoring in French Language Studies. I take a lot of Computer Science classes because that would have been my minor if I'd found out about it sooner.</p>

      <p>I am proficient in HTML and CSS. I am also learning Javascript, Python, and Django. I also speak French and Spanish, while we're talking about languages. I know some Russian, but I wouldn’t try actually talking to me. I’ve also recently made the commitment to start learning Korean, because I just watched a drama in Korean that I really, really liked.</p>

      <p>The Adobe products in which I am proficient include InDesign, Flash, and Dreamweaver, although my preferred weapons of choice are Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

      <p>My favorite editor is Sublime. I’m trying out Emacs, but there’s a learning curve. I hear that’s the one all the cool kids use, anyway.</p>
